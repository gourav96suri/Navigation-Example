Android App which tests the basics of how to navigate between two activities using Intents (Switching between different activities). The demo video of the App is available on youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbQ6AIkuANo   If it is helpful to you then follow me (you can give it a star too), I will make some more useful standard codes.. Happy Coding :)
